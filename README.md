# Challenge Problem 4

## Deadline: March 3, 2023 by midnight

Note: While high-level discussion is allowed and encouraged for the challenge problems, these problems should be completed and submitted individually.

### Description

Explore various Naive Bayes Algorithms in the given Colab notebook. Then, answer the following questions.

### Part 1: Gaussian Naive Bayes

1.   Give 1-2 sentence description of the distribution assumed in this algorithm.

Gaussian Naive Bayes follows a Guassian distribution pattern. This algorithm also supports continuous valued features.

2.   Provide your observations on the performance of this algorithm on the wine data (comparisons with other algorithms below are encouraged).

 Compared to the other algorithms Guassian Naive Bayes is the most accurate at just over 94%. Additionally, when compared to the other algorithms the precision score is the highest too. The f1-score of this algorithm is overall the highest.

### Part 2: Multinomial Naive Bayes

1.   Give 1-2 sentence description of the distribution assumed in this algorithm.

The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is based on the Naive Bayes algorithm but is used for multinomially distributed data. This distribution utilizes vectors for each class.

2.   Provide your observations on the performance of this algorithm on the wine data (comparisons with bayes algorithms below are encouraged).

Based on the performance analysis the performance of this algorithm is not as good as the Guassian Naive Bayes algorithm. The accuracy of this algorithm is much lower and the precision has a wide variety between 59%-92%.

### Part 3: Complement Naive Bayes

1.   Give 1-2 sentence description of the distribution assumed in this algorithm.
